# Hi there :)
## I'm a computer science student on AGH in Cracow.

### I'm currently working on:
- [Sanitary network simulation]([(https://github.com/nataliadybczak/sanitary-network-simulation)]) - discrete simulation using Pygame and Mesa.

### Previous projects:
- [Physics Simulation Language]([https://github.com/Irvinnee/PhysicsLanguage]) - programming language implemented in Python and ANTLR4 that implements simulation of physics particles.
