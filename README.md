# Hi there :)
## I'm a computer science student on AGH in Cracow.

### I'm currently working on:
- [Sanitary network simulation](https://github.com/nataliadybczak/sanitary-network-simulation) - discrete simulation using Pygame and Mesa.
- [Double Push-Out Transformation Visualisation](https://github.com/esarna/double-push-out-visualisation) - simple graph transformation visualisation using Double Push-Out
- [Environment Conditions Sensor](https://github.com/Irvinnee/IoT-plant) - IoT Device which checks conditions of the environment (soil/air temperature, humidity, etc.) on ESP-WROOM-32 using ESP-IDF

### Previous projects:
- [Physics Simulation Language](https://github.com/Irvinnee/PhysicsLanguage) - programming language implemented in Python and ANTLR4 that implements simulation of physics particles.
