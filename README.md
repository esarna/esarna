# Hi there :)
## I'm a computer science student on AGH in Cracow.

### I'm currently working on:
- [Sanitary network simulation](https://github.com/nataliadybczak/sanitary-network-simulation) - discrete simulation using Pygame and Mesa.
- [Double Push-Out Transformation Visualization](https://github.com/esarna/double-push-out-visualisation) - simple graph transformation visualization using Double Push-Out.
- [Darmstadt traffic visualisation](https://gitlab.com/Rolowany/darmstadt-simulation)
- [Obieraczka Project](https://gitlab.com/obieraczka-project/obieraczka-model) - creation and testing of MiniZinc model which optimizes a problem of assignment of students to elective subjects.

### Previous projects:
- [Physics Simulation Language](https://github.com/Irvinnee/PhysicsLanguage) - programming language implemented in Python and ANTLR4 that implements simulation of physics particles.
